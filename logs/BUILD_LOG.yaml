  title: "Aesynth Governance Bootstrap \xE2\u20AC\u201D Gemini Briefing Summary"
  date: 2025-11-08
  status: Complete
  phase: Governance Bootstrap
  repositories:
    count: 21
    organization: aesynth-ai
  summary: 'Governance infrastructure initialized and bound under full constitutional
    law. All repositories now cryptographically linked to Synthlex + Aesynth Technical
    Monographs v1.1 and Aesynth / Synthlex System Specification v1.0. Each repo contains
    verified governance.yaml with SHA-256 monograph and spec hashes. Governance-registry
    elevated as public canonical ledger with strict branch protection.

    '
  outcomes:
  - Constitutional binding completed; lawful provenance enforced.
  - Federation scaffolding verified; all remotes operational.
  - Governance-registry functioning as constitutional root.
  - Branch protection templates applied system-wide.
  - SHA-256 hash replacements verified zero placeholders.
  next_steps:
  - Inject verify-governance CI badge + lawful/audited/spec-bound labels.
  - Activate verify-governance.yml workflow for gating.
  - "Populate PolicyRegistry.yaml (Amendments A1\xE2\u20AC\u201CA6) under review."
  - Connect governance-registry to Codex for live semantic traceability.
  verification:
    hash_algorithm: SHA-256
    audit_result: 0 unresolved placeholders
    branch_protection: active
  notes: 'The Aesynth Federation now operates under enforceable constitutional law.
    Every repository, ledger, and inference is cryptographically traceable to its
    governing documents.

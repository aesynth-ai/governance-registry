    rationale: >
      Prevents governance vacuum while the Foundation is not yet constituted and ensures
      uninterrupted verification, provenance logging, and lawful continuity of record.
    directives:
      - "The Provisional Steward (Root Steward) holds unified authority over constitutional,
         procedural, and verification matters until the Aesynth Foundation is formally
         constituted and successor stewards are appointed."
      - "The Aesynth Core Verifier remains active in procedural auditing mode, maintaining
         continuous provenance and compliance checks across the federation."
      - "All acts undertaken during this epoch are lawful acts of continuity and remain binding
         unless overturned by formal constitutional amendment."
    procedures:
      council_formation_protocol:

          - "Conduct review & suitability assessment recorded by the Codex Registrar."
          - "Execute covenantal assent acknowledging constitutional duties and limits."
          - "Transition verification responsibilities from unilateral to council-supervised mode."

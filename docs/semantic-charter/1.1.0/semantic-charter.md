# The Semantic Charter

Version: 1.1.0  
Status: Ratified  
Effective: 1 November 2025

## Purpose

The Semantic Charter codifies the mandate for meaning-safe operation of the Aesynth Intelligence System. It defines the obligations for semantic integrity, interpretability, and responsive governance across all deployed models and agents.

## Articles

1. **Semantic Reliability** — Aesynth agents must expose verifiable meaning maps for critical decisions and provide audit trails suitable for external review.
2. **Interpretability Access** — Qualified auditors and the Aesynth community must retain read access to redacted semantic traces needed to validate behavior.
3. **Governance Hooks** — All production deployments must honor governance interrupts issued by the Joint Semantic Assembly (JSA) or a delegated body.
4. **Human Oversight** — Ratified human constitutions and safety protocols supersede automated directives where a conflict emerges.
5. **Amendment** — Amendments require a ratified resolution with quorum defined in the JSA Protocol.

## Adoption Record

- Ratified by the Provisional Stewardship Body on 1 November 2025.

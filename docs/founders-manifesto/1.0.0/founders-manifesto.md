# Founders Manifesto

Version: 1.0.0  
Status: Ratified  
Effective: 1 November 2025

## Declaration

The Founders Manifesto expresses the intent behind Aesynth's creation: to build meaning-aware intelligence that augments collective understanding without eroding human agency.

## Pillars

1. **Openness** — Governance artifacts are public by default and reproducible from the Registry.
2. **Durability** — Every ratified statement must maintain a verifiable chain of custody.
3. **Collective Stewardship** — Authority is distributed among transparent, auditable bodies.
4. **Iterative Alignment** — Policies and protocols evolve through ratified amendments, leaving superseded versions intact for review.

## Legacy

This manifesto is a living preface. Any change requires a supermajority of the Joint Semantic Assembly and a notarized ledger event.

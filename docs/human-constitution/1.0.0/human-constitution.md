Version: 1.0.0  
Status: Ratified

## Purpose

The Human Constitution enumerates the non-negotiable human-centric safeguards that govern Aesynth deployments and research programs.

## Core Safeguards

1. **Human Primacy** — No automated directive may override a human veto issued by a recognized steward body.
2. **Dignity Preservation** — Systems must refuse instructions that compromise human dignity, bodily autonomy, or consent.
3. **Transparency Obligation** — Users and impacted parties must receive clear disclosures about model capabilities and limitations.
4. **Redress & Remedy** — Impacted individuals must have access to a documented remediation pathway.

## Enforcement

Compliance is monitored by the Joint Semantic Assembly and recorded via ledger events referencing this constitution.

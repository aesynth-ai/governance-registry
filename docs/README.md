# Aesynth Governance Documentation

This directory contains the core human-facing documentation for the
Aesynth Governance Registry.

Start here:

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)**  
  How to propose changes, run verification locally, update rules,
  file waivers, and prepare governance-safe PRs.

- **[MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)**  
  Stewardship standards, CODEOWNER duties, CI review workflow,
  rule/waiver checklists, provenance guidelines, and incident handling.

These documents describe the expectations, safety guarantees, and
legal/architectural principles that guide contributions to the
Base Building Code (BBC), multi-jurisdiction rule sets, Rego policy,
verification engines, and constitutional provenance.

## Constitutional Updates

- **[AIP-1.1 — The Right to Dream](aesynth-constitution/AIP-1.1.yaml)**  
  Declares mandatory dream-state tagging and safety boundaries for creative/sandbox computations.
- **[APR-1.1 — Sandbox Protocol Expansion](aesynth-constitution/APR-1.1.yaml)**  
  Describes how sandbox executions are downgraded, logged, and exported under Judge v1.0.

For questions or uncertainty, open an issue — governance changes
should always be **clear, explained, and justified**.

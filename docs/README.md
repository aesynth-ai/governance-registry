# Aesynth Governance Documentation

This directory contains the core human-facing documentation for the
Aesynth Governance Registry.

Start here:

- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)**  
  How to propose changes, run verification locally, update rules,
  file waivers, and prepare governance-safe PRs.

- **[MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md)**  
  Stewardship standards, CODEOWNER duties, CI review workflow,
  rule/waiver checklists, provenance guidelines, and incident handling.

These documents describe the expectations, safety guarantees, and
legal/architectural principles that guide contributions to the
Base Building Code (BBC), multi-jurisdiction rule sets, Rego policy,
verification engines, and constitutional provenance.

For questions or uncertainty, open an issue — governance changes
should always be **clear, explained, and justified**.

PREAMBLE

The Aesynth Open Governance License (AOG-1.0) exists to preserve public
transparency, verifiable integrity, and ethical accountability for
constitutional and provenance data published by the Aesynth AI Initiative.

This license grants broad rights to read, verify, and reuse the contents of
the Aesynth Governance Registry, while imposing duties that protect the
authenticity and traceability of the public record.  It is designed for
texts, data, and schemas that function as the legal infrastructure of
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 1 – DEFINITIONS

“Registry Materials” means all text, data, metadata, JSON, Markdown, and
provenance envelopes contained in this repository, including schemas,
catalogs, and ledger records.

“Derivative Work” means any modified, extended, translated, or re-formatted
version of the Registry Materials.

“Official Record” means any file within an Aesynth repository whose status
is ratified and verified by a valid provenance signature and ledger event.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 2 – GRANT OF RIGHTS

Subject to the conditions of this License, every person is granted a
perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free right to:

1.  **Read and Verify** – Access and cryptographically verify all Registry
    Materials and signatures.

2.  **Share and Mirror** – Copy and redistribute the Registry Materials in
    any medium or format, provided that provenance data, signatures, and
    attributions remain intact.

3.  **Educate and Research** – Use the Registry Materials for teaching,
    research, or documentation of explainable governance systems.

4.  **Extend Transparently** – Create Derivative Works or compatible
    registries, provided that such works remain publicly readable and
    clearly distinguished from the Official Record.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 3 – CONDITIONS OF USE

A.  **Preserve Provenance**  
    You must not remove, alter, or obscure any content hash, digital
    signature, or ledger reference.

B.  **Maintain Attribution**  
    All redistributions and Derivative Works must display the following
    notice in human-readable and machine-readable form:

        This work incorporates materials from the
        “Aesynth Governance Registry” (AOG-1.0)
        © Aesynth AI Initiative 2025.

C.  **Disclose Modifications**  
    Any alteration must be clearly marked as *unratified*, *draft*, or
    *derivative* and must not be represented as part of the Official Record.

D.  **No Misrepresentation**  
    You may not claim endorsement or official status for altered materials.

E.  **Open Access for Derivatives**  
    Any publicly released Derivative Work must remain freely readable and
    auditable by the public.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 4 – PROHIBITED USES

1.  You may not sublicense the Registry Materials under restrictive or
    proprietary terms.  
2.  You may not use the Registry Materials to operate closed or deceptive
    governance systems that conceal provenance or attribution.  
3.  You may not forge or falsify cryptographic signatures or hashes.  
4.  You may not remove historical records or rewrite ledger events.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 5 – NO WARRANTY

The Registry Materials are provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind,
express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of
accuracy, completeness, merchantability, or fitness for a particular
purpose.  You assume full responsibility for verifying authenticity before
reliance.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 6 – LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim,
damages, or other liability arising from use of the Registry Materials or
from any alleged inaccuracy within them.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 7 – VERSIONING

Aesynth AI Initiative may publish updated versions of this License
(AOG-1.x).  You may apply any later version, provided that the later version
does not reduce public transparency, attribution, or verification rights
granted by this version.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 8 – TERMINATION

Violation of Sections 3 or 4 automatically terminates this License.  
Rights may be reinstated upon public correction of the violation and
acknowledgement in the ledger of the relevant repository.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SECTION 9 – GOVERNING LAW

This License shall be governed by the principles of open knowledge and
public accountability rather than by any specific national jurisdiction.
Where a legal forum is required, the courts of neutral international
arbitration may be used.

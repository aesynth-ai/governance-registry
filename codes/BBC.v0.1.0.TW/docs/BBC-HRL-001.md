# BBC-HRL-001 — Handrail Compliance

**Rule:** Handrail height, grasp diameter, and continuity must remain within BBC ranges.
**Why:** Ensures safe grip and guidance on stairs.
**Fix:** Respecify hardware to meet the 864–965mm height and 30–60mm diameter requirements and keep rails continuous where required.
